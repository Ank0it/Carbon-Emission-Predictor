# **App Name**: EcoPredict

## Core Features:

- Data Input: Accepts user input for features like fuel consumption, energy usage, vehicle type, distance traveled, and industrial activity.
- CO₂ Emission Prediction: Uses a pre-trained regression model to predict CO₂ emissions based on the input data.
- Real-time Display: Displays the predicted CO₂ emissions in a clear and understandable format.
- Tool Assistance: Uses a large language model (LLM) as a tool to make some smart recommendations. The LLM decides when to notify the user about some relevant public datasets that may influence some input values of your tool's input fields, such as official fuel consumption or electricity ratings for different makes/models of cars.
